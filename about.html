                <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
                <p>I'm Eric John Dailisan, a proud Computer Engineering graduate with a strong passion for both technology and creativity. As I embark on my journey to becoming a skilled Web Developer and Graphic Designer, I’m driven by a deep interest in blending the art of design with the precision of programming. I believe that the web is not just a tool for communication, but a canvas where functionality and creativity can come together to build immersive and engaging user experiences. From a young age, I’ve always been fascinated by how technology can shape the world, and that curiosity led me to pursue Computer Engineering. Throughout my academic journey, I developed a strong foundation in problem-solving, coding, and system development. But beyond the technical side, I’ve also nurtured a creative side through my love for graphic design and visual arts, including portrait-making as a hobby.</p>
